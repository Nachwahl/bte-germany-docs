# Useful Tips

1. Redraw the generated building outlines with `/tpll` and `//line`. This is more accurate and you can draw in structures that were not generated.
2. Check if your building has the correct height to make it as realistic as possible
3. Use as much detail as possible. To make your facade look stunning try to add:
   _Halfslabs_, _Stairs_, _Trapdoors_, _Blockcombination_ or _Blockvariation_
4. Outdoor details can add a lot to your building. Build streets, trees or gardens.
5. Roofs do not have to be built out of stairs. Use whole blocks to match the roof to the accurate color and slope.

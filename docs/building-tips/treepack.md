# How to use the Treepack

The treepack works as follows: You take a tool of your choice in your hand and enter this command:

    //schbr trees/TREE_TYPE/TREE_SCALE/*@** -place:bottom -yoff:2


:::info

Replace "_TREE_TYPE_" with, `oak`, `spruce`, or `birch`.<br/>
Replace "_TREE_SCALE_" with, `S`, `M` or `L` i.e. (small, medium or large)

:::


Example: `//schbr trees/oak/M/*@** -place:bottom -yoff:2`

Then you can right click to place the trees with random order and rotation. If you use two tools, you can even build a mixed forest within a few seconds!

:::tip

The trees of the challenge have been integrated, i.e. these trees are especially beautiful: **oak S/M/L**, **spruce L** and **birch M**.

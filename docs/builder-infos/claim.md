# Claim your area
To claim the area you are building in on [this map](https://buildtheearth.net/map), send a message to your responsible @Region Manager. This should include coordinates, screenshots and reference pictures of your build location. Similar to the application, you must have at least two buildings already built.

[Here](https://map.bte-germany.de/) is an overview of where construction has already taken place. You can add your building to this list yourself by doing the following steps:

1. Ingame send the command `/maplink [Email address, you are using to login to Discord]`.
